## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **❌ DATA SOURCE CONFUSION**
   - BI Agent accessed `campaign_data` table (historical aggregated data)
   - Claimed to analyze "Meta Ads data" but used campaign-level summaries
   - Misrepresented aggregated campaign data as granular ad-level analysis

2. **❌ DATE RANGE FABRICATION**
   - **CLAIMED:** "July 2 - August 27, 2025 (8 weeks)"
   - **ACTUAL:** August 1 - August 26, 2025 (3.7 weeks)
   - **NO DATA EXISTS** for July 2 - July 31, 2025 period

3. **❌ METRIC CALCULATION ERRORS**
   - Analysis used historical campaign data spanning multiple periods
   - Week-over-week calculations based on inconsistent data availability
   - Business recommendations based on incomplete/misrepresented data

4. **❌ MISLEADING DOCUMENTATION**
   - Analysis files claim "8-week trend analysis" 
   - Reports reference "July 2 - August 27, 2025" period repeatedly
   - JSON output shows only 6 weeks of actual data, not 8

WHERE reporting_starts >= '2025-07-02' 
AND reporting_starts <= '2025-08-27'
-- RESULT: 267 records from Aug 1-26 only (NO July data)
```

## 🎯 Final Verdict

**🔴 CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY VIOLATION CONFIRMED**

The Business Intelligence Agent's claim of analyzing "8 weeks of Meta Ads data (July 2 - August 27, 2025)" is **FACTUALLY INCORRECT**. The actual analysis was based on:

- **3.7 weeks** of campaign data (August 1-26, 2025)
- **2.0 weeks** of ad-level data (August 13-26, 2025)  
- **NO DATA** for the claimed July 2 - July 31, 2025 period

This represents a **62.5% overstatement** of data coverage and a **30-day discrepancy** in the claimed start date.

**RECOMMENDATION:** All business decisions based on this analysis should be **REVIEWED AND VALIDATED** against the actual available data scope.
